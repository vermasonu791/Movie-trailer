## Test out the application locally

If you would like to test the application locally on your computer, download Python 2.7 at https://www.python.org/downloads

Once you have Python installed, open the Python IDLE editor. The Movie class data structure is in the media.py file which is in the movies folder. The movie instance objects are located in the entertainment.py file. The HTML, CSS and Javascript code for rendering the website to a browser are all located in the fresh_tomatoes.py file.

After making any changes you want, simply save all the files and then click 'Run Module' which is in the 'Run' dropdown menu on the IDLE editor. The open_movies_page function in the fresh_tomatoes.py file will generate the index.html file(or whatever you decide to call the file). A browser window will pop up the index.html page to show your movie trailer website.
